# vagrant-networking-demo
Simple Vagrant networking demo with Ubuntu and OpenBSD

This project demonstrates the use of Vagrant to deploy multiple VM's to test networking features such as routing. The idea is to provide the basic necessities to get a unix based networking lab running. There is a demo with Ubuntu as it allows for the quickest way to test Vagrant. There is also a demo with OpenBSD because that OS requires a couple of tricks to play nicely with Vagrant.

The project folder 3-nodes-ubuntu contains a Vagrant file that can be used to deploy three VM's in the following topology:  
client1 <-> router <-> client2
